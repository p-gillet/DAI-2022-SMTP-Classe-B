# DAI-2022-SMTP-Classe-B

## Deliverables

You will deliver the results of your lab in a GitHub repository. You do not have to fork a specific repo, you can create one from scratch.

Your repository should contain both the source code of your Java project and your report. Your report should be a single `README.md` file, located at the root of your repository. The images should be placed in a `figures` directory.

Your report MUST include the following sections:

* **A brief description of your project**: if people exploring GitHub find your repo, without a prior knowledge of the API course, they should be able to understand what your repo is all about and whether they should look at it more closely.

* **What is MockMock (or any other mock SMTP server you decided to use)?**

* **Instructions for setting up your mock SMTP server (with Docker - which you will learn all about in the next 2 weeks)**. The user who wants to experiment with your tool but does not really want to send pranks immediately should be able to use a mock SMTP server. For people who are not familiar with this concept, explain it to them in simple terms. Explain which mock server you have used and how you have set it up.

* **Clear and simple instructions for configuring your tool and running a prank campaign**. If you do a good job, an external user should be able to clone your repo, edit a couple of files and send a batch of e-mails in less than 10 minutes.

* **A description of your implementation**: document the key aspects of your code. It is a good idea to start with a **class diagram**. Decide which classes you want to show (focus on the important ones) and describe their responsibilities in text. It is also certainly a good idea to include examples of dialogues between your client and an SMTP server (maybe you also want to include some screenshots here).
